```
 Em
So young, just begun
 D
Don't need to live to know
       A
What I've become
        Em
When ya wake up

Still in your make-up
D
You'll make it home just
 A
Fine without breaking down
Man that's so young
That's so young

 Em
Stay calm, we'll all just get along
 D           A
Sit around, pretending like nothing's wrong
 Em
So long, love letter
   D          A
But you and I are gonna live forever

 C                         B7
I don't need to make amends
                         Em
But I'm done going undercover
                       G
I just want to find a friend
           B7            C
I don't need another lover
                        B7
One day the world may end
                               Em
But there's still plenty to discover
                       G
Till then I'll just pretend
          B7                Em
I don't need another lover

Em
So young, loaded gun
D                      A
Oblivious to what the trigger does
    Em
Will ya wake up

Never gonna make up
D                     A
Got ammunition on a mission
                        Em
We're gonna shoot you down
Man that's so young
That's so young

Em
Knocked out with the Midas touch
D                   A
A champion wearing golden gloves
       Em
Got you punch drunk, seeing stars
D                       A
Little birdies singing "why'd ya fall so hard?"

 C                         B7
I don't need to make amends
                         Em
But I'm done going undercover
                       G
I just want to find a friend
           B7            C
I don't need another lover
                        B7
One day the world may end
                               Em
But there's still plenty to discover
                       G
Till then I'll just pretend
          B7                Em
I don't need another lover

C
My light burning bright
 B7                         Em
Everlong till the thrill is gone

Love's my battle cry
D
It's never wrong
               C
How I stay so strong

I'll fight all my life
 B7                       Em
I'm all like I can't go on
                   D
When I can't go on

We're gonna live forever

We're gonna live forever

 C                         B7
I don't need to make amends
                         Em
But I'm done going undercover
                       G
I just want to find a friend
           B7            C
I don't need another lover
                        B7
Today the world will end
                               Em
You never know we may recover
                   G
No time left to pretend
          B7                Em
I don't need another lover

C                      B7
Oooh... it's troubling
                                            Em
When the belly of the beast starts rumbling
                         G
Oooh... it's getting too hot
                B7                             C
Like the summer in the city that we're living in
C                      B7
Oooh... it's troubling
                                            Em
When the belly of the beast starts rumbling
                         G
Oooh... it's getting too hot
                     B7                            C
Like the summer in the city that we're living in
